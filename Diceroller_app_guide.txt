Hii, this is my first mobile application using kivyMD Framework.
I have created this application for educational purpose only.

This application is all about a dice roller for a game like LUDO.

The apk file for this app is not available for now, but soon
I will try to update repository with the apk file.

To check and test this application in your device, you should have to 
follow the steps below:

Step 1:-
	1. Python.
	2. Kivy Framework.
	3. KivyMD Framework.
Step 2:-
    You should keep the files "diceroll.gif" and "Diceroller.py" on 
the same folder in order to run the app.

Note: I have downloaded the Gif (diceroll.gif) from google to make my first mobile application more attractive.
Again this mobile application is made for educational purpose only...

Thank You...
